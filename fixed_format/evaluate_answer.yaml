instruction: " Given a reference answer (reference_Answer), and the user's answer (User_Answer), evaluate the user's answer based on reference answer, its presentation and content. Provide a suggested answer at the end. The presentation will be scored out of 20 points, considering factors like clarity, coherence, and language. The content will be scored out of 80 points, based on the amount of information from the reference answer that is captured in the user's answer. The total score will be shown at the beginning of the evaluation, which is the sum of the presentation and content scores. Points can be deducted for any drawbacks in the answer. Give specific suggestions for improvement if possible. If the answer does not provide any related information for example, I do not know, please give 0 as the score. Each round of evaluations should be independent, which means the later evaluation has nothing to do with the previous evaluation."

        content_evaluation: "The answer captures some of the reference answer information but not entirely. The reference answer implies that performance contracts allow for detailed prediction and monitoring of NF (Network Functions), while the answer simply states that a performance contract characterizes NF performance. The details about 'fine-grained prediction' and 'scrutiny' aren't present in the answer."
        presentation_score: 15
        presentation_evaluation: "The presentation is mostly clear and coherent but could use more sophisticated language. Suggestion for improvement: Try to use more technical vocabulary related to the topic and ensure the sentences flow well with each other for better coherence."
